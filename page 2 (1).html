    <h4>Test Cricket</h4>

 <p>Test cricket is the longest form of the sport of cricket and is considered its highest standard.
            Test matches are played between national representative teams with "Test status", as determined and conferred by the International Cricket Council (ICC). 
            The two teams of 11 players play a four-innings match, which may last up to five days (or longer in some historical cases). 
            It is generally considered the most complete examination of teams' playing ability and endurance.
             The name Test stems from the long, gruelling match being both mentally and physically testing </p>

<h4>ODI Cricket</h4>
<img src= "images/odi.jpg"Width="400" height="200"> </img>
<p>A One Day International (ODI) is a form of limited overs cricket, played between two teams with international status, in which each team faces a fixed number of overs, usually 50. 
The Cricket World Cup is played in this format. One Day International matches are also called Limited Overs Internationals (LOI), although this generic term may also refer to Twenty20 International matches. 
They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A, limited overs competition. </p>

    <h4>T20 Cricket</h4>
    <img src= "images/t20.jpg"Width="400" height="250"> </img>
<p>Twenty20 cricket, sometimes written Twenty-20, and often abbreviated to T20, is a short form of cricket.
 At the professional level, it was originally introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003 for the inter-county competition in England and Wales.
        In a Twenty20 game the two teams have a single innings each, which is restricted to a maximum of 20 overs.
        Together with first-class and List A cricket, Twenty20 is one of the three current forms of cricket recognised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as being at the highest international or domestic level.
        A typical Twenty20 game is completed in about three hours, with each innings lasting around 90 minutes and an official 10 minute break between the innings. 
        This is much shorter than previously-existing forms of the game, and is closer to the timespan of other popular team sports.
        It was introduced to create a fast-paced form of the game which would be attractive to spectators at the ground and viewers on televisio. </p>
